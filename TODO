Options to add:
- detect MAC OR give MAC as input in .ini
- same for IP
- Crop everything until first tcp segment in capture: 
    ID SYN handshake
    If not found start with the first TCP seg we find (not S, SA or A)
- A solution for offsets: identify first TCP seg, TCP ack and first block ack or MAC ack
- rework each .py using scapy
- make sure no duplicate IP exist

version 0.1
- fixed IP, capture exists already, load all file to memory
- start w/ IP only and check that 1-to-1 correspondance with a MAC address. Usually 1IP - 1 MAC: this correspondance can change. Add a mecanism that checks this correspondance in case of an error.
